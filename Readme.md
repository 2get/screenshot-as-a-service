# Screenshot Service

  A simple screenshot web service powered by [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/).

## Setup

  First [install](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) phantomjs,
  then clone this repo and install the deps:

```
$ npm install
```

  Run the app:

```
$ node app
Express server listening on port 3000
```

## Usage

```
wget -O screenshot.png http://localhost:3000/www.google.com
```

## Configuration

Create a `config/development.yaml` or a `config/production.yaml` to override any of those settings:

```
browser:
  command: phantomjs
  options: ''
  viewport:
    width:    1024
    height:   600
screenshot:
  directory: '/tmp'
```

For instance, if you use a wrapper command for phantomjs and need to setup a proxy in development, create a `config/development.yaml`as follows:

```
browser:
  command: phantomjs-wrapper
  options: '--proxy=myproxy:1234
```
